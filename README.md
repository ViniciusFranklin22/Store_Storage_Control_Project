**Beverage Store Inventory Optimization Project**  
  
**Introduction**  
I created this project to optimize the inventory of a friend's beverage store. The idea came to me one day when I witnessed the sale of a product that was out of stock. There was no proper control over the available products, which motivated the creation of this application.  

**Project Description**  
This application was developed using Python, primarily with the Tkinter and SQLite3 libraries. Initially, the idea was just to control the inventory, but I realized the project could go much further. Although not yet implemented, there are several simple customizations and optimizations that can be made based on the specific needs of the business.  

**Current Features**  
Customer Registration: Register new customers.  
Product Registration: Register new products.  
Inventory Management: Add and manage stock levels.  
Price Updates: Update product prices.  
Sales Page: Process sales, ensuring products are in stock before authorizing the sale.  
**Future Implementations**  
Sales Profile Analysis: Identify sales trends and patterns.  
Inventory Automation: Automatically renew inventory based on predefined parameters.  
Tax Assistance: Facilitate tax declaration.  
Profit Optimization: Adjust profit margins based on sales data.  
**Installation**
Clone the repository:    
bash  
Copy code  
git clone https://github.com/ViniciusFranklin22/Projeto_Controle_Estoque_Loja   
Install the necessary libraries:    
bash  
Copy code   
pip install tkinter sqlite3  
Change the database path variable in the eng_dados.py file to the correct path on your system.  
**Usage**  
Open the application.  
Use the customer registration feature to add new customers.  
Use the product registration feature to add new products.  
Manage stock levels through the inventory management feature.  
Update product prices as needed.  
Process sales through the sales page, which ensures products are in stock before authorizing the sale.  
**Conclusion**  

This application is a valuable tool for any beverage store, providing efficient inventory control and optimizing various business aspects. All necessary files are available in the repository. To use them, simply download the required libraries and adjust the database path variable in the `eng_dados.py` file.
