**Beverage Store Inventory Optimization Project**  
  
**Introduction**  
I created this project to optimize the inventory of a friend's beverage store. The idea came to me one day when I witnessed the sale of a product that was out of stock. There was no proper control over the available products, which motivated the creation of this application.  

**Project Description**  
This application was developed using Python, primarily with the Tkinter and SQLite3 libraries. Initially, the idea was just to control the inventory, but I realized the project could go much further. Although not yet implemented, there are several simple customizations and optimizations that can be made based on the specific needs of the business.  

**Current Features**  
Customer Registration: Register new customers.  
Product Registration: Register new products.  
Inventory Management: Add and manage stock levels.  
Price Updates: Update product prices.  
Sales Page: Process sales, ensuring products are in stock before authorizing the sale.  
**Future Implementations**  
Sales Profile Analysis: Identify sales trends and patterns.  
Inventory Automation: Automatically renew inventory based on predefined parameters.  
Tax Assistance: Facilitate tax declaration.  
Profit Optimization: Adjust profit margins based on sales data.
